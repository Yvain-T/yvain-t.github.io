I’m **Yvain Tisserand**, a senior researcher and computer scientist with a strong background in **affective computing** and **computer graphics**. My main research interest lies in **Virtual Humans**—creating realistic digital characters who can perceive, emote, and interact within immersive environments. I’m also passionate about **applied VR projects**, where these Virtual Humans play a role in training, awareness campaigns, or experimental psychology studies.

In my work, I combine:
- **Emotion & Cognition**: Integrating affective computing to simulate a virtual human’s emotional and physiological states.  
- **Realistic Rendering & Animation**: Leveraging advanced graphics techniques for life-like body and facial animation.  
- **Immersive Interaction**: Exploring virtual reality as a medium for learning, empathy-building, and human–computer interaction research.

Feel free to explore my **[Publications](#)** and **[Projects](#)** to learn more about my work. If you have any questions or potential collaborations in mind, don’t hesitate to reach out!
