# Welcome
I’m a senior researcher and computer scientist specializing in *computer graphics* and *affective computing*, currently based at the **Swiss Center for Affective Sciences (CISA)** at the **University of Geneva**. My research focuses on the creation and simulation of **Virtual Humans**, particularly within immersive VR environments.

Over the years, I’ve worked on a range of projects, from modeling emotional facial expressions to simulating virtual clothing for industrial applications. Building on my PhD work at the University of Geneva, *"Fast Prototyping and Deformation of Virtual Humans"*, I combine core computer science skills with advanced VR technologies to develop believable, responsive digital characters. These **Virtual Humans** serve as research tools across various domains, including psychology, medical training, cultural heritage, and novel forms of user interaction.

## What I Do

- **Affective Computing & Emotional Simulation**  
  Design Virtual Humans endowed with emotional and physiological states, bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and human-centered design.

- **Computer Graphics & Animation**  
  Implement advanced 3D pipelines for facial/body animation, garment simulation, and realistic rendering.

- **Immersive VR Applications**  
  Develop VR-based training tools, serious games, and interactive experiences that leverage Virtual Humans as key participants.

- **Research & Teaching**  
  Contribute to the academic community through publications, conference talks, and mentoring, particularly in the fields of VR, AI, and computational modeling.

## Publications & Contact

A full list of my publications, including journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers, can be found on my [Publications](/publications/) page. Feel free to explore my **[Projects](/projects/)** section for more details about ongoing and completed initiatives.


I’m always open to new collaborations and excited to discuss innovations at the crossroads of VR, emotion research, and realistic virtual humans.
