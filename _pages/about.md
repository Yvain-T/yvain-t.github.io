# Welcome
**Yvain Tisserand** is a senior researcher and computer scientist specializing in computer graphics and affective computing. His research focuses on the creation and simulation of **Virtual Humans**, particularly in immersive VR environments. His work spans a range of projects, from modeling emotional facial expressions to simulating virtual clothing for industrial applications.

Building on his PhD research at the University of Geneva, "*Fast Prototyping and Deformation of Virtual Humans*", Yvain combines core computer science skills with advanced VR technologies to create believable, responsive digital characters. These Virtual Humans are designed as research tools across domains including psychology, medical training, cultural heritage, and interactive user experiences.

## What I Do

- **Affective Computing & Emotional Simulation**  
  Design Virtual Humans endowed with emotional and physiological states, bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and human-centered design.

- **Computer Graphics & Animation**  
  Implement advanced 3D pipelines for facial/body animation, garment simulation, and realistic rendering.

- **Immersive VR Applications**  
  Develop VR-based training tools, serious games, and interactive experiences that leverage Virtual Humans as key participants.

- **Research & Teaching**  
  Contribute to the academic community through publications, conference talks, and mentoring, particularly in the fields of VR, AI, and computational modeling.
