# Welcome

I’m **Yvain Tisserand**, a senior researcher and computer scientist with a background in **computer graphics** and **affective computing**. My main research interest lies in the creation and simulation of **Virtual Humans**, particularly within **immersive VR applications**. Over the years, I have contributed to various projects and research endeavors, ranging from emotional facial expression modeling to virtual clothing simulations for industrial use cases.

Drawing on my PhD work at the University of Geneva—*“Fast Prototyping and Deformation of Virtual Humans”*—I integrate **computer science** fundamentals (C++, C#, OpenCV, and more) with cutting-edge **VR** technologies (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, motion capture systems) to develop believable and responsive digital characters. These **Virtual Humans** often serve as research platforms for psychological studies, medical training, cultural heritage preservation, and novel user-interaction paradigms.

## What I Do

- **Affective Computing & Emotional Simulation**  
  Design Virtual Humans endowed with emotional and physiological states, bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and human-centered design.

- **Computer Graphics & Animation**  
  Implement advanced 3D pipelines for facial/body animation, garment simulation, and realistic rendering.

- **Immersive VR Applications**  
  Develop VR-based training tools, serious games, and interactive experiences that leverage Virtual Humans as key participants.

- **Research & Teaching**  
  Contribute to the academic community through publications, conference talks, and mentoring, particularly in the fields of VR, AI, and computational modeling.

## Publications & Contact

A full list of my publications, including journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers, can be found on my [Publications](/publications/) page. Feel free to explore my **[Projects](/projects/)** section for more details about ongoing and completed initiatives.


I’m always open to new collaborations and excited to discuss innovations at the crossroads of VR, emotion research, and realistic digital humans. Let’s connect!
