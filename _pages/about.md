# Welcome

I’m **Yvain Tisserand**, a senior researcher and computer scientist with a background in **computer graphics** and **affective computing**. My main research interest lies in the creation and simulation of **Virtual Humans**, particularly within **immersive VR applications**. Over the years, I have contributed to various projects and research endeavors, ranging from emotional facial expression modeling to virtual clothing simulations for industrial use cases.

Drawing on my PhD work at the University of Geneva—*“Fast Prototyping and Deformation of Virtual Humans”*—I integrate **computer science** fundamentals (C++, C#, OpenCV, and more) with cutting-edge **VR** technologies (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, motion capture systems) to develop believable and responsive digital characters. These **Virtual Humans** often serve as research platforms for psychological studies, medical training, cultural heritage preservation, and novel user-interaction paradigms.

## What I Do

- **Affective Computing & Emotional Simulation**  
  Design Virtual Humans endowed with emotional and physiological states, bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and human-centered design.

- **Computer Graphics & Animation**  
  Implement advanced 3D pipelines for facial/body animation, garment simulation, and realistic rendering.

- **Immersive VR Applications**  
  Develop VR-based training tools, serious games, and interactive experiences that leverage Virtual Humans as key participants.

- **Research & Teaching**  
  Contribute to the academic community through publications, conference talks, and mentoring, particularly in the fields of VR, AI, and computational modeling.

## Selected Projects

### Emotional Virtual Humans
- **Description**: Real-time simulation of emotional facial expressions and physiological states (pupil dilation, sweat, tears) driven by affective computing.
- **Role**: Designed the ANS-based (Autonomic Nervous System) simulation architecture and integrated it with 3D character rigs.

### VR Training & Psychological Research
- **Description**: Created immersive experiences for training law-enforcement officers, raising climate-change awareness, and studying pain management in children.
- **Role**: Developed interactive VR scenarios, integrated real-time data collection (gaze, heart rate), and implemented storytelling-driven user experiences.

### Virtual Clothing & Fast Prototyping
- **Description**: Pioneered an automatic 3D garment positioning system using surface metrics, applied in industrial projects for virtual try-on and digital manufacturing.
- **Role**: Led the research and development of inverse-kinematics-based garment fitting and triple-pass body animation systems.

### Cultural Heritage & Traditional Sports Preservation (RePlay)
- **Description**: EU-funded project aiming to digitize, preserve, and gamify traditional sports and cultural practices.
- **Role**: Contributed real-time musculoskeletal modeling, motion capture integration, and dynamic VR simulations.

### fromRollToBag (EU-H2020)
- **Description**: Focused on consumer-driven virtual design and digital manufacturing workflows.
- **Role**: Developed an automatic pipeline for virtual try-on applications, connecting garment creation to interactive 3D environments.
