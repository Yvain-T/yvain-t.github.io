shortname: "ConsciousnessModel"
index: 2
abstract: "Exploring the mechanisms of subjective consciousness, this project integrates computational neuroscience with AI to model perception, imagination, motivation, and social cognition. By using projective geometry and active inference, our approach provides new insights into how consciousness structures experience, guides behavior, and influences interactions in virtual and robotic environments."
