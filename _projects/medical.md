abstract: "This project investigates the use of virtual reality (VR) to reduce pain and anxiety in children undergoing medical procedures. By immersing young patients in engaging, interactive virtual environments, the goal is to distract attention from discomfort, promote relaxation, and improve overall procedural experience. The approach aims to support non-pharmacological pain management while enhancing clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction."
