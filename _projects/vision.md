abstract: "This project explores the use of virtual reality (VR) to simulate vision under a variety of conditions. It includes the replication of medical visual impairments, such as cataracts and macular degeneration, as well as the simulation of visual perception through assistive technologies like retinal implants. These simulations aim to support clinical training, inform the design of visual aids, and improve understanding of altered visual experiences"
