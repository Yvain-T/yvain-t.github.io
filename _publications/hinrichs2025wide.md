This study explores how visual field size in simulated artificial vision affects social perception in virtual reality. Sighted participants completed tasks involving social cue recognition, tracking, and navigation. A 45-degree visual field significantly improved accuracy, speed, and self-assessment in social tasks compared to a 20-degree field, especially in structured environments. The findings underscore the value of a wider visual field for enhancing social interactions in artificial vision systems.
