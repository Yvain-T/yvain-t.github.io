The creation of virtual representations of real humans is a challenging task that has been investigated for the last three decades. It utilizes a multi-dimensional approach that is used extensively in computer graphics and computer animation applications, and it also involves various fields. This work focuses on facilitating and improving the process of the representation and animation of virtual humans so that they can be used in a wide range of real-time applications. Investigations and contributions to the different steps of the virtual human creation and animation pipeline are detailed in this thesis. The aim of this work is to improve some of the existing procedures involved in the creation of a virtual human by reducing the cost factor, enhancing automation and improving realism. Within this work, we focus on three main areas of virtual human creation: body modelling, virtual clothing, and real-time body deformation.
